===TO-DO===
SiC, 2 atom unit Zinc-Blende cell, a_0=8.2392 Bohr. 
Energy study: VMC energy with and without 1 and 2 body Jastrow factors. DMC energy with Jastrow. converge error bars to a little less than 1mHa per SiC pair (depends on cost with Jastrow). (~1/2 day)

Choose one PP to use for the next step. Leaning towards TN_DF thus far. (~moments)

Energy Study: SiC, 54 atom unit Zinc-Blende cell. Vary a_0. We may try an opium PP if TN core is too large or BFD_HF doesn't converge sufficiently fast. (1/2 day to days)
