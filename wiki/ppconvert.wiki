#summary Using ppconvert to convert pseudopotentials

= Ken Esler's ppconvert =

Ken has been kind enough to develop a tool for the conversion of pseudopotentials.

{{{
Usage:  ppconvert  options
  Options include:
   --casino_pot fname
   --fhi_pot    fname
   --bfd_pot    fname
   --gamess_pot fname
   --casino_us fname
   --casino_up fname
   --casino_ud fname
   --xml  fname.xml
   --tm   fname.tm
   --hdf5 fname.h5
   --upf  fname.upf
   --fhi  fname.fhi
   --fpmd  fname.xml
   --casino fname.xml
   --log_grid
}}}

== input PPs ==
casino, fhi bfd, gamess.

== output PPs ==
qmcpack (xml) tm, hdf5, upf, fhi, fpmd, casino

== reference state ==
 -s_ref "1s(1)" ... s state occupations in ensuing qmc calculation.

 -p_ref similar to s but for p states

 -d_ref similar to s but for d states

Note that the reference state should include only the valence electrons.  
For example, for a sodium atom with a neon core, the reference state would be "1s(1)".  
Note that the "s_ref" needs to include a 1s state (potentially with 0 occupancy), the 
"p_ref" needs to include a 2p state, and the "d_ref" needs to include a 3d state.  One 
reference state should be included for each channel in the pseudopotential.

== options ==
 log_grid. This should always be included for qmcpack PPs (may be default).

== Example ==
for sodium PP from Trail Needs tabulated to qmcpack and pwscf
 * Download the summary, pp.dat, and awfn files.
 * in the same file execute,

{{{
ppconvert --casino_pot pp.data --casino_us awfn.data_s1_2S --casino_up awfn.data_p1_2P --casino_ud awfn.data_d1_2D --log_grid --upf Na.TN.upf --xml Na.TN.xml
}}}

for sodium PP from Trail Needs gamess format to qmcpack and pwscf
{{{
ppconvert --gamess_pot Na.GAMESS --s_ref "1s(1)" --p_ref "1s(1)" --d_ref "1s(1)" --log_grid --upf Na.upf --xml Na.xml
