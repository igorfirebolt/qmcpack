#summary Version of QMCPACK which runs on NVIDIA GPUs

= Introduction =
The loosely-coupled population of walkers in QMC simulations make a nearly ideal case for acceleration on GPUs.  We have developed a partial port of QMCPACK to run on NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA.  For large systems, the code runs up to 15 times faster on a G200 GPU than on a quad-core Xeon processors.

The GPU version can be built by adding the flag "-DQMC_CUDA=1" to the cmake command.  

A poster on the GPU port was presented at Supercomputing 09:

A paper on the work has been submitted and is under review.
