#summary Version of QMCPACK which runs on NVIDIA GPUs

= Introduction =
The loosely-coupled population of walkers in QMC simulations make a nearly ideal case for acceleration on GPUs.  We have developed a partial port of QMCPACK to run on NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA.  For large systems, the code runs up to 15 times faster on a G200 GPU than on a quad-core Xeon processors.

Currently, the source exists as a branch from the mainline code, but we hope to merge it back in soon.  In the meantime, it may be check out with:
