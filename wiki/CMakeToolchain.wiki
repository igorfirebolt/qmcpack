One can prepare  a toolchain file, which is especially useful  on large
clusters with changing environments. The toolchains in `topdir/config` are
used by the developers on the NSF and DOE sites. Use them as a starting
point and customize them for your system.

In your build directory
{{{
cp ../config/AbeMvapich2.cmake yourtoolchain.cmake
.... modify yourtoolchain.cmake ....
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=yourtoolchain.cmake ..
make
}}}
