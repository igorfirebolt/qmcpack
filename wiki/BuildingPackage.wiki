= Getting and building QMCPACK =
== Prerequisite ==
In order to install QMCPACK, users have to install several required packages.
These packages are included in standard Linux/cygwin distributions or can be
downloaded by following the links. If these libraries are installed in standard
directories, /usr /usr/local and /sw (Mac), no action is necessary.
Alternatively, environment variables XYZ_HOME should be set. Here, XYZ stands
for the name of package; the build utility can locate the libraries and use
them.

With few exceptions, the build utility cmake will look for XYZ_HOME/include for
the header files and XYZ_HOME/lib for the library files. When multiple
environment variables apply to a library, e.g., blas/lapack, the library is
searched according to the listed order.

||Name	||Category	||Environment variables 	||Comments||
||cmake	||utility|| || source and binary distribution on multiple platforms||
||blas/lapack	||Numerical library||MKL_HOME, LAPACK, ATLAS||Alternatives: vendor-provided blas, e.g., ESSL||
||hdf5 	||I/O	||HDF5_HOME, HDF_HOME	||source and binary distribution on multiple platforms ||
||libxml2	||I/O	||LIBXML2_HOME	||Standard library for Linux distributions||
||boost 	||C++ standard libraries|| BOOST_HOME	||Using only the header files. No need to compile anything. Simply download and unpack the package.||
||einspline||c library for 3D bspline||EINSPLINE_HOME||see [HowToEinsplineLib Using Einspline library]||
||fftw||c library for FFT||FFTW_HOME||http://www.fftw.org/||

On many HPC centers, these packages are managed by utilities like *module* and
*softenv*. Consult the documentations on each site.

Notes on Numerical Libraries: If lapack/blas or atlas is not in your standard
paths, do one of the followings. location is where the libraries are located.

For bash users,
{{{
  export LAPACK="-L/location -llapack -lblas"
  export ATLAS="-L/location -llapack -lf77blas -lcblas -latlas" 
}}}
For tcsh users,
{{{
  setenv LAPACK "-L/location -llapack -lblas"
  setenv ATLAS "-L/location -llapack -lf77blas -lcblas -latlas"
}}}

== Build QMCPACK with cmake ==
Require [http://www.cmake.org cmake] to compile qmcpack package Theoretically
speaking, QMCPACK can be used on any UNIX/LINUX machine with recent GNU C/C++
compilers. For cmake documentation and guides, consult
[http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake cmake wiki]. Once the code is downloaded to
_qmcpack_ directory, simply type

{{{
cd qmcpack/build
cmake ..
make
}}}

If everything goes well, then you should see *`qmcpack/build/bin/qmcapp`*. 
Consult CMakeExplained for cmake-related topics.
