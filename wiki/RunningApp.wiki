= Running applications =

 * Seiral/OpenMP applications 
 {{{
 export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
 build_path/bin/qmcapp input-xml
 }}}
  * OpenMP is turned on automatically if the compiler supports it. These compilers are extensively tested with OpenMP.
    * GNU compilers 4.2 and higher
    * Intel compilers 
 * MPI applications 
 {{{
 mpirun -np 4 build_path/bin/qmcapp input-xml
 }}}
  * If OpenMP is enabled, make sure to set `OMP_NUM_THREADS`. On many systems, the default `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is set to the maximum allowed number of threads per SMP node.
  * Consult your system documentation for MPI jobs.

= Before running QMCPACK =

We can seldom write down the many-body trial wavefunction from scratch. The most general scenario follows
 * run DFT/HF or beyond HF calculations to obtain single-particle orbitals (typical KS orbitals) or coefficients of multi determinants.  
 * extract the Fermion wavefunctions run VMC/Optimization run DMC or RQMC

= Preparing input files =
The input XML for qmc sections are extremely simple. The major difficulties
concern trial wavefunctions. The components of a trial wavefunction can be
divided into 
 * Jastrow functions: one, two, and three (no four body yet) 
 * Fermion wavefunction: Slater determinant, Geminal

Jastrow functions are rather simple but have to be defined by users.

On the other hand, users seldom have to prepare Fermion wavefunctions. They are
extracted from outputs of third-party packages by tools (See [QMCToolsHowTo]).
Users may have to modify the name or id of the wavefunctions but again this can
be achieved by command-line options for the tools.

We have not implemented backflow wavefunctions but think we can use
Jastrow/Fermion to represent them.

= Electronic structure packages QMCPACK can utilize =
 * Gaussian
 * Gamess (XML version)
 * Casino (only for Gaussian basis set)
 * Quantum espresso 
 * abinit
 * qbox

Potentially, these packages will be supported
 * NWChem
 * MondoSCF

Often, we can use utilities for Casino package but a preferred way is to work
with the packages directly if they are under open-source licenses. For example,
a postprocessing code pw2qmcpack.F90 for Quauntum espresso is implemented using
their libraries and HDF5 library.
