QMCPACK, framework for Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, implements advanced QMC
algorithms.  The code development is led by J. Kim and the main contributors
are the members of the electron structure group of Profs. Martin and Ceperley
at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

 * Active developers: J. Kim, K. Esler, J. McMinis, B. Clark, J. Gergely, C. Yang
 * Past contributors: S. Chiesa, K. Delaney, J. Vincent

= How to contribute to QMCPACK =

== Development ==
You can get involved with the development by contacting any of the owners of
this project. Substantial experience in C++ and parallel programming
(MPI/OpenMP) and knowledge in the electronic structure and quantum Monte Carlo
methods are required. 

In many cases, QMC simulations start with the electronic structure calculations
using DFT, HF and other many-body methods.  A few tools have been developed but
any tools that can make QMCPACK useful and usable are always welcome.  The
input/output uses XML and HDF5 and we will provide the schemas to assist
developers of other electronic structure codes and tools.

== Applications ==
Anyone can download QMCPACK and use it for their research.  We ask the users to cite
our work by including
{{{
QMCPACK, http://www.mcc.uiuc.edu/qmcpack
}}}
until technical papers on QMCPACK are published.

== Documentation ==
Use *issues* and this *wiki* to add tutorials, sample data etc.
