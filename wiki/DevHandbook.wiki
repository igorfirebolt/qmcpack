 * More on [CMakeExplained  cmake use]

== Guideline for the developers ==
 * As the creator of C++ said, there is no coding standard everyone agrees on. Check out  http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq2.html#coding-standard
 * Remember that the less you write, the better. There are well-designed classes available in STL and boost libraries and to a lesser degree in qmcpack for what you are trying to do. 
 * Use generic and inline functions as much as  you can. 
 * We have not enforced any coding standard but few are emerging. See [http://www.boost.org/development/header.html#SampleHeader a sample header file adopted by boost.org]
  * indentations: 2 space, disable tabs
  * brackets: `{ //stuff here }`
  * loops
  * class names: choose the name that can mean something to other developers
   * WhatIsThisClass
   * what_is_this_class
   * local variable names: hide them as much as you can within the current scope, all lower cases
 * Learn how to use doxygen
 * vimrc.txt customized for Mac OS Terminal
