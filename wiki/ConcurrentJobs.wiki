#summary running multiple instances concurrently

||[Welcome Home]||[TutorialsList Tutorials]||

One can submit a job which combines multiple QMC simulations. This is useful
when a simulation involves scanning a parameter space, configuration space and
and k-point intergration. 

In order to run multiple instances, two options are available.
  * Use `--clones [int]` option. 
  {{{qmcapp --clones 4 GeH4.xml}}}
  ** Multiple xml files (qmc instances) can be used.
  ** All the qmc instances are cloned by the same number of copies.
  * prepare a file which lists the input xml files:
  {{{
  GeH4.xml
  GeH4.xml  
  GeH4.xml
  GeH4.xml
  }}}

When *cloning* is done, the out files have an extra field, g### to indicate a MPI group for each qmc instance.

Any combination of input files can be used but one should consider the load-balance issues. We will introduce *timestamp*

== What is going on inside ==
 * Utilize MPI groups to partition MPI nodes into groups.
 ** Each MPI group is an independent unit.
 ** The names, e.g., psi0, ion0, can be identical or distinct: a MPI has a separate name space.
 * Each group operates on a system.
 * Use analysis tools to combine the data

A common example of multiple systems is with multiple twist angles as explained in [How to handle multiple twist angles].
