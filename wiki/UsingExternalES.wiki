#summary How to use external electron-structure code

= Utility to prepare input files for QMCPACK =
 * Source distribution contains a directory src/QMCTools with few utility tools one can use to convert input/output of other packages for QMCPACK
 * The tools are not automatically built but one can modify CMakeLists.txt file
 {{{
   SET(BUILD_QMCTOOLS 1)
 }}}
 * A useful tool is `convert4qmc` for localized-orbital basis set. It can process
  * Gaussian03
  * Gamess (version supporting xml)
  * Casino
  * TurboPair (very limited and need editing)
 * `pw2qmcpack.x` for Quantum Espresso
  * This is an add-on program to Quantum Espresso package. It is not officially included with the distribution but will be available to those who are interested.
  * This code is released under GPL as Quantum Espresso

 * Execute pw2qmcpack

 * If everything works well, two files
  * `c.pwscf.h5` : binary data
  * `c.pwscf.xml` : qmcsystem xml file to describe the physical systems and wavefunctions

The input files for each command are given in italic.
||*steps*|| *command *||
||Run Gaussian 2003 || `/usr/apps/chemistry/queues/qg03 geh4` ||
||Add Gaussian utility programs by ||`source /usr/apps/chemistry/gaussian/g03util`||
||Convert binary file GeH4.chk 	||`formchk GeH4.chk` ||
||Convert ascii GeH4.fchk for QMCPACK ||`convert4qmc -gaussian GeH4.fchk` ||

Once these steps are executed, two input files are generated for qmcpack
 * xml file containing 
 {{{
 <qmcsystem>
 </qmcsystem>
 }}}
 * hdf5 file containing large datasets such as eigen vectors
